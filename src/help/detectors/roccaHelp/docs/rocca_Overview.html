<h1>Rocca</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2><br>
<p>The ROCCA (Real-time Odontocete Call Classification Algorithm) module classifies delphinid whistles based on spectrographic measurements extracted from whistle contours.  The contour extraction algorithm <a href="rocca_WhistleSchoolClassification.html">measures</a> 54 different variables for each contour.  A subset of these variables is then used in conjunction with a user-selected classification model to classify the whistle to species.</p>
<br>
<p>Individual whistle classifications are grouped into user-defined <a href="rocca_Sidebar.html">Detection Numbers</a>.  A classification is also given to detection numbers based on the species within that group with the <a href="rocca_WhistleSchoolClassification.html">highest classification scores</a>. </p>
<br>
<h3>General Principle of Operation</h3>
<p>There are 5 main steps to the classification of a whistle:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	  <p>User selects a whistle from the spectrogram display</p></li>
	<li><p>The whistle is captured and displayed in a new spectrogram window</p></li>
	<li><p>The whistle contour is extracted and the user is allowed to manipulate it, if desired</p></li>
	<li><p>The contour parameters are measured</p></li>
	<li><p>The contour is classified using the currently-loaded classifier model</p></li>
	<li><p>The classified whistle statistics are added to the specified School/Detection/Sighting</p></li>
</ol>
