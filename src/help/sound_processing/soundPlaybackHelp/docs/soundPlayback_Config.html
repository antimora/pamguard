<h1>Sound Output</h1>


<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To access the module's settings, select <em><strong>Detection>Sound
Output... </strong></em> from the main menu . This will bring up the Sound Output
dialog similar to the one shown below.</p>

<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>The sound output module requires a source of raw data before it
can operate. Select a raw data source from the drop down list.</p>
<p>Select the data channels. Note that a sound card will only
be able to play back two channels at a time and you will therefore only
be able to check one or two boxes.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>The available options will depend on the type of sound acquisition
device.</p>

<h4>Audio files and File Folders</h4>
<p>Select the output device. This will be a list of sound cards on
your system.</p>
<p>Set the sample rate. This can be automatically selected to be the
same as the sample rate in the data, in which case playback will be real
time, or you can slow down or speed up playback from a file by entering
a different sample rate.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> During file analysis, if no channels are
selected and there is no playback, analysis will continue at the maximum
rate possible using all available processor power. If sound playback is
enabled, then analysis will proceed at the speed governed by the sound
playback rate. If the processor can't keep up with analysing data at the
playback rate, then playback will appear interrupted and 'glitchy'</p>
<p>It is possible to re-configure channels during analysis, so if
you are analysing a lot of data, you may want to occasionally turn on
sound output on one or two channels to have a listen, then turn them off
again so that it processes as fast as possible.</p>

<h4>Sound Cards</h4>
<p>When real time data re being collected using a sound card, you <strong>must</strong>
select the same device for sound output as is being used for sound
input. i.e. you cannot collect real time data through an external USB or
Firewire sound card and output that sound through your laptops internal
sound card. If you do, the clocks on the two devices are likely to drift
apart over time which can make PAMGUARD unstable.</p>

<h4>ASIO Sound Cards</h4>
<p>When using ASIO sound card input, playback will automatically be through the same 
device so there are no user options.</p>

<h4>Other devices</h4>
<p>Other data acquisition devices are currently not supported for sound output</p>
