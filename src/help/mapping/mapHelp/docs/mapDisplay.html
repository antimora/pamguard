<h3>Map</h3>

<p>
The map provides a plan view of the survey area. The figure below is an example screen shot of the map in its simplest configuration.

<p>
The vessel which hosts the GPS is indicated by a red icon and the course of the vessel, as derived from the GPS data, is indicated by the direction of the vessel icon. </p>
<p>
By default, when PAMGUARD starts up the vessel icon is placed in the centre of the map. Left clicking on the map allows the user to drag the map in the direction of the cursor.
</p>
<p>
The vessel’s recent track is indicated by a white line.</p>
<p>Selecting <strong><i>Map>Map options</i></strong> allows the user to set the “map lifetime” – i.e.  
  the length (in time) of the vessel track line.</p>
<p>
The map also provides lines of latitude (red) and longitude (blue). 
The resolution of the latitude and longitude lines displayed is automatically set, 
dependent on the map zoom factor. In the upper right hand corner of the map, a compass 
icon indicates the rotation of the map. 
</p>
<p>
Selecting <strong><i>Map>Map file</i></strong> opens a file chooser dialogue where the user can 
choose a *.asc format map file for display.</p>

Detection event graphics can be overlaid on the map by right clicking and selecting
 the desired overlay type from a drop-down menu.
