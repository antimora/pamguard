/**
 * Class for handling arrays of Complex data. 
 * <p>
 * This class should be used wherever possible in preference to 
 * arrays of Complex objects since this class realised purely 
 * on an array of primitives, assumed to be in real, imaginary
 * order which should give a speed improvement over previous methods. 
 * <p>
 * functions exist within this to convert to an array of Complex
 * objects to support current PAMGUARD funcitonality but it is hoped
 * that modles will gradually be rewritten so theh don't need this.
