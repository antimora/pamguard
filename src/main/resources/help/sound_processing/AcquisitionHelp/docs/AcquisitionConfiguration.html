<h1>Sound Acquisition Configuration</h1>
<p>
To access the module's settings, select <em><strong>Detection>Sound Acquisition...
</strong></em> from the main menu and click on the name of your module. 
This will bring up an Audio Data Acquisition dialogue similar to the one shown below.</p> 
<p><center><img alt="Sound Acquisition Dialogue" src="images/AcquisitionDialog.png" /></center></p>
<br>
<p>
The dialog is divided into four separate regions. the information in each region may vary 
depending on the type of input device you are using.  
</p>

<h3>Data Source Type</h3>
<p>
From the drop down list, select the type of input device you wish to use. 
Different input devices offer different numbers of channels, sample rates and 
quality of data. For many applications using just two channels of data in the 
human audio band, a standard sound card is adequate, but 
for higher sample rates, or higher numbers of channels, ASIO sound cards or 
National Instruments Data Acquisition devices may be required
</p>
<p>
Note that not all input types are supported on all platforms.<br>

<h3>Select audio line (or specific input device or file)</h3>
<p>
The information displayed here will vary depending on the type of Data Source. 
Please refer to instructions on specific data source configuration.
</p>

<h3>Sampling</h3>
<p>
The information displayed here will vary depending on the type of Data Source. 
Please refer to instructions on specific data source configuration.
</p>

<h3>Calibration</h3>
<p>
The peak to peak voltage range of the device and the preamplifier gain are used by some PAMGUARD modules to calculate
absolute received signal levels in dB re. 1&mu Pa. For some devices, this information may be 
filled in automatically, for others you will need to enter it yourself. If you don't know the 
input sensitivity of your device, don't worry, PAMGUARD will run, but amplitudes may not be accurate.   
</p>
<p>
The bandwidth information is not currently used anywhere in PAMGUARD.
