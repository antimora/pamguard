<h1>Sound Output</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The sound output module can be used to play back sounds from
PAMGUARD through a sound card or other data acquisition device.</p>

<p>This allows you to aurally monitor sounds after they have been modified by PAMGUARD 
modules such as <a href="../../FiltersHelp/Docs/filters_filters.html">IIRF Filters</a>
or the <a href="../../seismicveto/docs/veto_overview.html">Seismic Veto</a></p>

<p>The availability of the sound output function depends on the type of input
selected in the <a href="../../AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">
Sound Acquisition</a> module. </p>

<p>With the exception of data read from file, 
sound output must be through the same device as is being used for sound input so that there is
perfect synchronisation between the clocks of the device being used for output and the device
used for input. </p> 

<p>The sound output module will currently work when analysing data from files of file folders, 
from sound cards, ASIO sound cards and with simulated data. 
It will not currently work with National Instruments DAQ cards. </p>

<br>
<h3>Creating sound output modules</h3>
<p>From the <em><strong>F</strong></em><strong><em>ile>Add
modules>Sound Processing </em></strong>menu, or from the pop-up menu on the data model
display select "<strong><em>Sound Output</em></strong>". Enter a name
for the new module and press Ok.</p>
<p>Sound output modules can be inserted anywhere in the PAMGUARD
data model where there are raw audio data such as the output of a <a
	href="../../AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">sound
acquisition module</a>, a <a
	href="../../FiltersHelp/Docs/Filters_filters.html">filter module</a>, a
<a href="../../decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">decimator</a>,
etc.</p>
