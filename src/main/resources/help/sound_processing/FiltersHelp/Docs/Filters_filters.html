<h1>IIRF Filters</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2><br>

<p>
IIRF (Infinite Impulse Response) Filters can be used to filter audio data within PAMGUARD  
</p>
<p>
They can be inserted anywhere in the PAMGUARD data model where there are raw audio data.<br>
Note that some other modules, such as the 
<a href = "../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/ClickDetector_clickDetector.html"> click detector</a> 
and the <a href = "../../decimatorHelp/docs/decimator_decimator.html">decimator</a>, use the same
filter modules, built into that module's functionality.</p>
<br>
<h3>Creating filters</h3>

<p>
From the <em><strong>File>Add modules>Sound Processing</strong></em> menu, or from the pop-up menu on the 
data model display select "<em><strong>IIRF Filters</strong></em>". 
Enter a name for the new filter modules (e.g. "Low Pass", "2kHz", etc) and press Ok.</p>
<br>

<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>The filers module requires a source of raw data before it can operate. 
This may come directly from a Sound Acquisition module (e.g. a sound card or a National Instruments board) 
or from processed data such as the output from a decimator or other filter. 
</p>
<p>
To set the filter data source, go to the <em><strong>Detection>"your filter name">
Filter Data Source"</strong></em> menu</p>

<p>
Select the data source and the channels you wish to filter from the checkboxes.
</p> 

<h3>Filter Settings</h3>
<p>
To configure the filter, open the Filter settings dialog from the <em><strong>Detection>"your filter name">
Filter Settings"</strong></em> menu</p>
<br>

<h4>Filter Type</h4>
<p>
Select the type of filter, which can be either Butterworth of Chebyshev. 
</p>
<p>
Select High pass, Band Pass of Low Pass
</p>

<h4>Cut off Frequencies</h4>
<p>
Set the filter cut off frequencies. Note that these should be greater than 0 and less than half of the sample rate.
</p> 

<h4>Filter parameters</h4>
<p>
Set the filter order and the band pass ripple (band pass ripple applies to Chebyshev filters only).  
</p> 
<p>
  Note that the higher the filter order, the sharper the filter cut off, but the 
  higher the load on the processor. Generally 2nd order or 4th order filters are
  adequate.</p>
<h3>
<p>Filter plots
  </h4>
<p>The filter dialog will display a bode plot (attenuation verses frequency) for the chosen filter
parameters and also a 'pole-zero diagram' (which is only meaningful to real geeks). </p>
