<h1>Database</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
PAMGUARD stores data from many modules in a database. The database not only stores 
detector output, but also detector configuration and settings so that it will effectively
form a single document at the end of the cruise, detailing how PAMGUARD was set up
and what was detected.   
</p>
<h3>Adding a database module</h3>
<p>
From the <strong><em>File>Add Modules>Utilities</em></strong> menu select <i>'Database'</i> to add a database to your
configuration.</p>
<h3>Configuring the database</h3>
<p>PAMGUARD can use either MySQL, Microsoft Access or OpenOffice databases. The setup for each is slightly 
different, but operation and integration into the rest of PAMGUARD is the same.</p>
<p>Which you use is purely a matter of personal choice.</p> 
<p>To configure the database, go to the <strong><em>File>Database Selection...</em></strong> menu to open the Database Selection dialog. 
  At the top of the dialog, select either MySQL, Microsoft Access or OpenOffice from the drop down list. Then refer to specific
  instructions for each database type below.

    <p><a href = "database_msAccess.html">Configure a Microsoft Access database</a></p><br>
    <p><a href = "database_OOo.html">Configure an OpenOffice database</a></p><br>
  
</p>
<h3>Adding tables to the database</h3>
<p>PAMGUARD will automatically add the necessary tables to your database.</p>
<p>
If a new detector module is added to PAMGUARD at any point, the database module is notified and will 
add the additional tables required. </p><p>If a module is removed and a table is no longer needed, that
table will be left in the database unaltered. </p>
<p>Should the definition of a table change due to the new release of a module which 
outputs additional information, any additional columns required will be automatically added
to existing tables.</p>

<h3>Other alterations</h3>
<p>You may add other tables and queries to the database without affecting PAMGUARD operation.
Additional tables will be ignored by PAMGUARD.</p>
<p>You can even add additional columns to tables which are used by PAMGUARD and these additional
columns will also be ignored.</p>
<p>However,  you should not change the format of any existing columns and do not create relationships
between tables which may not always be satisfied or PAMGUARD may be unable to write data to
the database.</p>
