<h1>Hydrophone Array</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>

The PAMGUARD system contains a flexible hydrophone array configuration
utility. A single array is loaded into memory and used at any one time,
although several different arrays may be managed and stored. An array
may consist of several different streamers deployed from various parts
of the vessel, but all hydrophones in all streamers must be included in
a single PAMGUARD array.</p>

<p>Each hydrophone array may contain up to 32 individual hydrophone
elements (transducers).</p>

<p>A one-to-many relationship exists between hydrophones and
software channels.</p>

<p>Each hydrophone element must be assigned to a streamer. The
actual coordinates for each hydrophone used by PAMGUARD are the sum of
the streamer coordinates and the individual hydrophone element
coordinates. Although this appears to introduce some redundancy
regarding the coordinates of each hydrophone, streamer assignment is
important for two reasons. Firstly, it allows the errors on the relative
locations of pairs of hydrophones to be more accurately defined (the
errors between hydrophones in different streamers will generally be
greater than the errors on a hydrophone in the same streamer). Secondly,
should a streamer be moved or shortened, it is easier to adjust the
coordinates of a single streamer than to adjust the coordinates of all
hydrophones individually.</p>

<h3>The Default Array</h3>
<p>The first time you run PAMGUARD, a default array consisting of
two hydrophone elements spaced 3m apart at 5m depth, 200m and 203m
astern of the vessel. Channels in the array are mapped 1:1 to ADC
channels 0 and 1.</p>
